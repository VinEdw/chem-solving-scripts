# chem-solving-scripts

This repo consists of two scripts that can be run with python and interacted with.
One can balance a chemical equation after the user inputs the chemical formulas for all the reactants and products.
The second script starts off the same, but then allows a user to input amounts (g/mol) of reactants or products, after which the program creates a table with most of the values you might need for a stoichiometry problem.
